### Changes made in Config:

1- Changing the default language to English

2- Setting the default fingerprint and user agent to Firefox

3- Enable the Fragment by default

4- Routing settings for Iranian sites

5- Activating the theme that is compatible with the system and displaying the download and upload speed

6- Adding sub links and five Warp servers

7- Minimal software activation at startup


### How to use
 - First, download and extract one of the 32 or 64-bit versions of V2RayN from the following link:

```
https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN/releases
```

 - Then download the guiNConfig.json and guiNDB.db file and copy it to the v2rayN > guiConfigs path and run the software.



### The V2RayN software needs to download the X-ray core and Singbox to run, which is recommended to download the relevant file from the following links and copy it to the v2rayN > bin path:


- Download the sing-box-plus kernel from the link below and put it in the bin folder under the sing_box folder.


```
https://github.com/kyochikuto/sing-box-plus/releases
```

- We're going to do the above steps for the X-ray core.


```
https://github.com/GFW-knocker/Xray-core/releases
```


### To make it easier, I did the steps and put the ready-made file for download in the release section, you can download and use it.


To update the previous version, just download the update.zip file and replace it in the previous folder.

**Warning: If you have a sub link or a personal configuration, be sure to back up!!**
